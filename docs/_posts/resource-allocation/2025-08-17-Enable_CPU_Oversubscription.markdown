t-description: "Enable CPU oversubscription by allowing more tasks than available CPU cores, especially in highly parallel workloads or multi-tenant environments. This can increase core utilization and reduce idle time, leading to improved performance and potentially better energy efficiencyâ€”if paired with fine-grained monitoring to mitigate overheads such as context switching and memory contention. Oversubscription may be implemented through the workload manager, allowing allocation of more slots than cores, and enhanced by runtime systems that adjust thread-to-core mapping"
