t-description: "Tune the configuration parameters of individual modules in a software workflow to optimize performance and energy consumption. This involves conducting controlled experiments to quantify the resource impact of different parameter settings and composing workflows accordingly. Parameters can be adapted based on current hardware resources, enabling lighter or deferred workloads when needed. Domain expertise is necessary to ensure meaningful parameter combinations, especially in specialized fields like molecular docking"
