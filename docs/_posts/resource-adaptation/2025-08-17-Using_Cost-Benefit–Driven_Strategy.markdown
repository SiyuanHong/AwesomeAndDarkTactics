t-description: "Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) of developing a self-adaptation strategy by quantifying the design-time costs (e.g., implementation effort, added complexity) and benefits (e.g., reusability, improved measurement of system qualities). This aids architects in deciding whether developing such a strategy is economically justified before implementation"
t-participant: "Software developers"
t-artifact: "Self-adaptation strategy design, System architecture"
t-context: "During system design when considering whether to incorporate a new self-adaptation strategy to address anticipated runtime variability"
t-feature: "Self-adaptivity framework"
t-intent: "To guide early architectural decisions regarding whether a self-adaptation strategy should be implemented based on expected ROI"
