t-description: "During operation, dynamically select the most cost-effective self-adaptation strategy based on observed and predicted costs and benefits across different scenario classes. Continuously monitor OSU (Overall System Utility) traces and select the strategy with the highest net benefit (benefit minus cost) for the current operating context"
